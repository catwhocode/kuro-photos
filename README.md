# Kuro Photos

Web app to share your favorite photos, made with laravel.

This web app was made for educationals purposes only.

I enjoyed so much learning Laravel, you can see the [docs here!](https://laravel.com/docs/).

## Quick setup

You can run this web app on your machine, just follow these steps:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/kuro-vale/kuro-photos.git```
2. ```cd kuro-photos```
3. ```composer install```
4. Create a .env, use .env.example as reference*
5. ```php artisan serve```

## Editing .env

If you want to use local storage just checkout to the commit c62701c8b662a34527ddd47a190b790c7f4d8467, that's before I setup Google Drive as a storage provider, commits after that are configs for deployment in Heroku.

- For Google Drive as a storage provider see [flysystem-google-drive-ext](https://github.com/masbug/flysystem-google-drive-ext).

More info about .env [here](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/configuration#environment-configuration)
